## Description

The Akans are a meta-ethnicity who primarily live in Ghana and Ivory Coast. They have a fairly unique naming system, which is based on the day in the week a child is born, and on the gender of the child. Children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. This website takes a user's birthday on the form provided and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
